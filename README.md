# Exploding Chickens web implementation (server)

Exploding Chickens is a spin-off of the popular game 'Exploding Kittens'. In this version, the protagonists are lovely chickens (but not so lovely, they can explode!). We created this unique implementation to conect people through a web implementation of this game, as previously it was only possible to play  when players were co-located.

This project offers an innovative user interface and features that enhance collaboration between players while providing a good user experience. These features include the ability to send friend requests, a chat to discuss strategies, high-quality graphics, and various fun play modes.

## Technologies

The server was implemented using the following technologies
-   REACT (MUI framework)
-   npm for package management
-   javascript
-   <add here further client technologies>
-   Web socket communication
-   Database to enable persistance
-   Google cloud for deployment
-   Git for version control and collaboration among developers
-   Github to follow agile practices

## Main components
-  [GameController.java] (https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-17/server/blob/develop/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/controller/GameController.java) : Handles client requests related to the game, such as starting, ending, and joining games. 
-  [GameEngineController.java] (https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-17/server/blob/develop/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/controller/GameEngineController.java) :  Manages requests concerning the game mechanics, including playing and drawing cards.  
-  [GameDeckService.java] (https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-17/server/blob/develop/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/GameDeckService.java) : Interfaces with the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/) : Interfaces with the Deck API to request and receive responses that are crucial for game functionality.
-  [GameEngineService.java] (https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-17/server/blob/develop/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/GameEngineService.java) :  Defines the logic driving game execution, including turn management and card effect processing.
-  [WebSocketService.java] (https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-17/server/blob/develop/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/WebSocketService.java) : Manages WebSocket communication to ensure a smooth user experience by sending updates to clients.


## Launch and Deployment
#### Cloning the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-17/client.git`\
`cd server`

#### Locally
- Build : `npm run build dev`
- Run : `npm run dev`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

You can verify that the server is running by visiting `localhost:8080` in your browser.
You can access the local hosted application (client) by visiting `localhost:3000`

NOTE: The server repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-17/client)

#### Cloud service
The application is hosted in google cloud service. 
To make a new deployment (release) it is necessary to merge the release branch with our main branch, this will automatically start the deployment in google cloud. It is important to also activate the database in google cloud (Ellaborate more about how to do this - if needed). 

Finally, it is a good practice to mark a new release with a tag, for example 'M4' represents the release at Milestone 4.

## Illustrations
The user flow is as follows:
1. An existing user logs in and a new user registers to the platform.
2. The user is redirected to the main dashboard where it is possible to create a new game, join to a existing one, go to user's profile, use the social features, or logout.
##### Case: Create game
3. The user can select the game configuration (private or public and number of players). By clicking the `SETUP GAME` button the game lobby is started where users can join and can be started once the number of players is reached. 
##### Case: Join game
3. The join game view will display the public available games, the user can either join a public game by clicking the join button or join a private game by entering the game id of the private game.
##### Social features
3. All players view will display all existing players. The user can search here for specific players, see their statistics, and add them to their friends network.
4. The friends view will display all the friends of the user, where the user can see if they are online and their avatar.
##### User Profile
3. The user profile shows the data given by the user upon registration and enables the user to modify this data, as well as completing their profile by adding an avatar, birthday, among others.
##### During the game:
1. The user can see in the top of the window who is the active player. When the user is the active player they can play their move cards (visible in their hand) and end their turn by grabing a card from the dealer pile (upside down cards).
2. The player can access the tutorial by clicking the `?` icon at any time of the game.
3. The player can interact with other players during the game by clicking the chat icon, which will pop out the chat.
4. The player can leave the game earlier by clicking the exit icon.
5. Upon completion of the game, a leaderboard with the position of the players will be displayed and users can go back to the home view.
##### Logout
1. Ends user session.


## Roadmap (next steps)
- On game store : Thinking from a buisiness perspective and a way to generate revenue an online store where users can buy upgrades to the game, customizable cards, among others would be a great addition to make this project self-sustainable.
- Enhance game features : To make a game fun and reach more people is necessary to innovate. It would be desired to incorporate new cards with new effects in the game as well as having more game modes that would cautivate all the players. For extending the game it would be necessary to develop the implementation of new cards or new game modes both for the client and the server, but the existing implementations can be followed as how-to guideline.
